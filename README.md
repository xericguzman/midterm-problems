# Midterm Problems

## Setup

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone it down
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (jest)
4. Run `npm run test` to run the tests

## Guidelines

1. Look in `main.js`. Each function has been started for you, but has no code or parameters. Your job is to finish them according to the tests in `main.test.js`
2. Read the test cases carefully
3. Do not edit the test file. All your work can and should be done within `main.js`
4. When writing code for some of the later functions, you are allowed (and encouraged) to use any of your previously defined functions
